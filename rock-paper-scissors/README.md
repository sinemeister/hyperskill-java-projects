Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors 15! This is a Java project which is one of the projects in the Hyperskill's
<a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/8"><i>Introduction to Java</i></a> track. Find the details of the project 
<a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/314?track=8">here</a>.

## About
In this project, you'll experience a twist on the classic game by playing with a wider variety of options. You'll be able 
to choose from a diverse set of possibilities including 
```rock```, ```gun```, ```lightning```, ```devil```, ```dragon```, ```water```, ```air```, ```paper```, 
```sponge```, ```wolf```, ```tree```, ```human```, ```snake```, ```scissors```, and ```fire```. 
This expanded range of choices adds a new layer of excitement and strategy to the game.

## Project Introduction

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a> is a popular hand 
game where two players simultaneously form one of three shapes with an 
outstretched hand. This implementation enhances the traditional game by introducing an array of unique
options, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. With so many possibilities to choose from, 
every round becomes a thrilling and strategic encounter.

## Number of Possibilities

Unlike the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors game, this variation offers a staggering number of possibilities. 
With 15 distinct options to select from, the game becomes a true test of your decision-making skills. 
The increased number of options opens up new strategic avenues, making each match more engaging and unpredictable.
